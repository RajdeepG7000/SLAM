I first tried to incorporate hector slam into the
mobile manipulator bot we made in the workshop.

That did not work well, I could not debug successfully.

I downloaded turtlebot3 for ros noetic and ran hector slam on it.
But hector slam was having trouble working as the hector_mapping node was not being launched properly.

I tried to make the files executable and change the parameters of the launch file and reinstall hector slam, but it did not work still.

I used the gmapping method of slam to start mapping the world instead, which worked successfully


I could not manage to do the second part of the task (stereo camera)
